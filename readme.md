## More in depth

The website lands you on a list of all cakes that are listed in the database.
By default you see only their pictures, but on hover action their names are displayed as an overlay over the image.
You are able to click on any of them to be taken to a page with details about the particular cake. 

On every cake page you get to see the particular cake's name, picture, comment and their yum factor (1-5). You can use the 'back' button here to get back to the home page where all cakes are listed.

On the home page you are also presented with an option to add a new cake.
That button will take you to a page where you can specify cake's name, image url, comment and yum factor. Upon successfully saving your entry you will be taken back to the home page.
. You can use the 'back' button on the 'add a new cake' page to get back to the home page where all cakes are listed.
